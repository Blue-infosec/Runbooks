# Picking Bounty

### Bug Bounty Platforms

* [BugCrowd](https://www.bugcrowd.com/)
* [HackerOne](https://www.hackerone.com/)


### Choosing a program

* New programs will have more undiscovered bugs
* Very experienced hunters that have participated in programs may have found many of the low hanging fruit or have early access so keep this in mind
* Consider the scope vs your skill set
* If looking at an older program look for more unusual bugs such as XXE,SSRF,Sensitive information disclosure
* Choose programs with *.domain.com if possible for bigger scopes
